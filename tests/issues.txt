# Issues:
1. Old files are terribly maintained

# Tasks:
1. Wrap package
2. Write tests for the modules.
3. Convert "path/to/file" to "os.path.join(path, to, file)
    a. Use Regex: ["'].*/
    b. Change path + "to/" + file as well, where some filenames and paths already have the "/" in it.

# Local Debugging:
pip uninstall -y bnw_tools
py -m build
pip install dist\bnw_tools-0.0.1.1.tar.gz

## if that version worked:
twine upload dist/*
username: __token__
password: a valid PiPy token
