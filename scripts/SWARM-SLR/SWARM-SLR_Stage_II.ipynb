    "Requirements:\n",
    "* use reliable sources\n",
    "* find relevant documents\n",
    "* find similar documents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reference manager**: First, a digital library setup is required. While this setup uses [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), others like [Citavi](https://www.citavi.com/) are equally valid, though some steps may need to be modified to fit their specific functionality. The following steps are recommended:\n",
    "    1. Install the Zotero application and browser plugin.\n",
    "    2. Sign in to your Zotero account for both.\n",
    "    3. **Zotero library**: Setup a library (/group) for this SWARM-SLR.\n",
    "    4. **Query collections**: For each search query, set up a collection (/folder) within this library.\n",
    "2. **Search engine**: While each SWARM-SLR only uses one *Reference manager*, it can and should use multiple search engines, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, OKMaps etc. Proceed as follows:\n",
    "    1. For each search engine:\n",
    "        1. For each query:\n",
    "            1. Create a collection (/folder) within the respective *query collection*. Select this collection with a left-click.\n",
    "            2. Open the search engine and use the query there.\n",
    "            3. Store each resulting page using the zotero plugin. While the results should be between 100 and 500, it is recommended to stop after cataloguing the first ~200 results.\n",
    "                * *Hint*: While you can open multiple tabs and increase the amount of search results per page, neither are recommended. Many search engines use temporary timeouts to sanction highly frequent access.\n",
    "            4. Then export the *query collection* as a BibTeX, for later reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reliability of sources is generally given for most dedicated scholarly search engines, with only minor curation required later on. While this step collects the majority of relevant documents will be collected during this step, there are various means through which the document set can be expanded later on. Examples include:\n",
    "* A highly relevant document is found and is used to query **Connected Papers**. This results in a recommendation of additional relevant papers, which can be downloaded as BibTeX and added via Zotero's \"Import from BibTeX\" functionality.\n",
    "* A (large) research project relevant to a research question is found and has it's publications catalogued. These results can be either added through BibTeX (see above), or looked up individually and added manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the *Zotero library*, a new collection should be created called \"others\". Within that, each of these examples (e.g. Connected Papers dump / research project publications / ...) is stored as it's own collection. Like the *query collection*, the BibTeX representation of these collections should be exported and stored."

    "Requirements:\n",
    "* find unindexed documents\n",
    "* identify document set gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all queries are processed and all apparent duplicates removed, the last step of task 3 includes three phases:\n",
    "1. **Find documents**: First, using Zotero's \"Find Available PDFs\" feature, all PDFs of the library are downloaded. Select the library, all references therin and find this feature by right-clicking any of them. After this is processed, presumably not all PDFs are found. By filtering the library by attatchments, each reference without PDF can be inspected. The research can attempt to find missing PDFs of promising references through other means, e.g. from their (departments) own library, by buying the work, contacting the authors or consulting a librarian.\n",
    "2. **Identify gaps**: If works knwon to the research that are deemed relevant to the research question are not in the Zotero library, they can be added as a dedicated collection within the \"others\" collection. Each document added here should be thuroughly inspected for the following reasons:\n",
    "    * Works of a second (non-english) language are usually not picked up by research engines. This can be circumnvented by translating each query to said other language, which provides extended scope in exchange for significant overhead in data management. While not recommended, this process is not adviced against, and can be conducted if the benefit is deemed worth the investment.\n",
    "    * Potentially, the search queries have a blind spot, either being to exclusive in their keyword combination, or not including an important keyword. This indicates a) an oversight in \"Step 2.4 Refine with related literature\", as well as b) a potential to soft-reset the survey back to Step 2.5. Generally, the collected references are not invalid and can be kept, leaving only the modified and added queries to be re-run.\n",
    "        * *Hint*: Instead of adding this kind of missing keyword ```B``` as ```A OR B```, a new query should be added without the ```A```. While in hindsight the ```A OR B``` variation would have been prefered, re-running the ```A OR B``` query will return already recorded results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Similarly, gaps can be identified without the right documents to fill them. If such a gap is identified *via known missing keywords*, proceed with a soft reset as described above. If not, this blind spot might be a finding of the SWARM-SLR itself, noting not a gap in the search, but in the literature itself.\n",
    "3. **Export library**: Concluding task 3, the Zotero library should be exported as BibTeX, this time with \"Export Files\" checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: Take note that this survey methodology can only process documents that have a PDF available. If the PDF is behind a paywall or otherwise unaccessible, the work will not be regarded beyond this point. This, amongst others, further supports the relevance of Open Science."

       " 'abstract': 'Within this study the influence of the interface description for partitioned Fluid–Structure Interaction ({FSI}) simulations is systematically evaluated. In particular, a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline ({NURBS})-based isogeometric mortar method is elaborated which enables the transfer of fields defined on low-order and isogeometric representations of the interface along which the {FSI} constraints are defined. Moreover, the concept of the Exact Coupling Layer ({ECL}) using the proposed isogeometric mortar-based mapping method is presented. It allows for smoothing fields that are transferred between two standard low-order surface discretizations applying the exact interface description in terms of {NURBS}. This is especially important for highly turbulent flows, where the artificial roughness of the low-order faceted {FSI} interfaces results in spurious flow fields leading to inaccurate {FSI} solutions. The approach proposed is subsequently compared to the standard mortar-based mapping method for transferring fields between two low-order surface representations (finite volume method for the fluid and finite element method for the structure) and validated on a simple lid-driven cavity {FSI} benchmark. Then, the physically motivated 3D example of the turbulent flow around a membranous hemisphere (Wood et\\xa0al., 2016) is considered. Its behavior is predicted by combining the large-eddy simulation technique with the isogeometric analysis to demonstrate the usefulness of the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method for real-world {FSI} applications. Additionally, the test case of a bluff body significantly deformed in an eigenmode shape of the aforementioned hemisphere is used. For this purpose, both “standard” low-order finite element discretizations and a smooth {IGA}-based description of the structural surface are considered. This deformation is transferred to the fluid {FSI} interface and the influence of the interface description on the fluid flow is analyzed. Finally, the computational costs related to the presented methodology are evaluated. The results suggest that the proposed methodology can effectively improve the overall {FSI} behavior with minimal effort by considering the exact geometry description based on the Computer-Aided Design ({CAD}) model of the {FSI} interface.',\n",

In particular, a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)-based isogeometric mortar method is elaborated which enables the transfer of fields defined on low-order and isogeometric representations of the interface along which the FSI constraints are defined. Moreover, the concept of the Exact Coupling Layer (ECL) using the proposed isogeometric mortar-based mapping method is presented. It allows for smoothing fields that are transferred between two standard low-order surface discretizations applying the exact interface description in terms of NURBS. This is especially important for highly turbulent flows, where the artificial roughness of the low-order faceted FSI interfaces results in spurious flow fields leading to inaccurate FSI solutions. The approach proposed is subsequently compared to the standard mortar-based mapping method for transferring fields between two loworder surface representations (finite volume method for the fluid and finite element method for the structure) and validated on a simple lid-driven cavity FSI benchmark. Then, the physically motivated 3D example of the turbulent flow around a membranous hemisphere (Wood et al., 2016) is considered. Its behavior is predicted by combining the large-eddy simulation technique with the isogeometric analysis to demonstrate the usefulness of the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method for real-world FSI applications. Additionally, the test case of a bluff body significantly deformed in an eigenmode shape of the aforementioned hemisphere is used. For this purpose, both ‘‘standard’’ low-order finite element discretizations and a smooth IGA-based description of the structural surface are considered. This deformation is transferred to the fluid FSI interface and the influence of the interface description on the fluid flow is analyzed. Finally, the computational costs related to the presented methodology are evaluated. The results suggest that the proposed methodology can effectively improve the overall FSI behavior with minimal effort by considering the exact geometry description based on the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model of the FSI interface. © 2019 The Authors.

Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U. Bletzinger et al. / Journal of Fluids and Structures 86 (2019) 368--399  1. Introduction  Fluid--Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations play an important role in modern engineering for the accurate prediction of phenomena which govern the mutual interaction between a fluid flow and a flexible structure. Their importance is especially highlighted in that this kind of events are governed by a highly nonlinear coupled behavior which cannot be predicted using solely a structural or a fluid simulation code but rather both together in a coupled environment. Within this study, the iterative Gauss--Seidel partitioned approach (Sicklinger, 2014; Sicklinger et al., 2014) is used for the FSI simulation, which is also known as serial staggered procedure with an iterative correction loop (Felippa and Park, 1980). It allows for a highly modular framework within which various fluid or structural solvers can be employed, whereas the fulfillment of the interface constraints is obtained in an iterative manner.  At the so-called wet surface between the fluid and the structural domains, the interface constraints have to be fulfilled typically at distinct descriptions of the FSI interface from each subdomain. This is typically due to the fact that diverse solution approaches are employed for solving the underlying fluid and structural Boundary Value Problems (BVPs) which are characterized by non-matching interface discretizations. For instance, the structural BVP is typically solved numerically using the Finite Element Method (FEM), whereas the fluid BVP is often numerically solved using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). Additionally, highly diverse mesh resolutions are encountered: Typically, fluid simulations need highly resolved boundary layers around the FSI interface, especially when applying the large-eddy simulation technique for turbulent flow fields, whereas a coarser discretization is typically sufficient for obtaining a satisfactory structural solution. Therefore, schemes have to be developed which allow the transformation of interface fields, for instance structural displacements and fluid tractions, across the common interface with minimal error. These methods comprise the nearest neighbor method, the nearest element interpolation, the barycentric interpolation and the mortar method amongst others (see Park et al. (2002), de Boer et al. (2007, 2008) and Wang (2016) for more details). It is especially important that the structural displacements are smoothly transferred onto the fluid FSI interface. Kinks on the surface due to a coarse finite element resolution on the structural side may lead to artificial shifts in separation and reattachment points which substantially influence the flow development and which in turn can cause the evolution of inaccurate deformation patterns due to the coupling.  Herein, standard finite element and isogeometric discretizations of geometrically nonlinear pre-stressed membrane structures are considered concerning the structural BVP. The widely used FVM method is employed for the discretization of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a recent numerical method for the approximation of BVPs which uses the exact geometric parametrization, in this study the NURBS basis functions, for the approximation of the problem’s unknown field(s). Among others, smoothness and high-order field approximations are some of the main benefits of IGA (see Cottrell et al. (2009) for more information). For the transfer of the structural displacement and fluid traction fields across the FSI interface, the mortar method is chosen in the present study. This method was initially developed for enforcing the continuity of the solution to variational problems on non-overlapping subdomains, which attain non-conforming discretizations along their common interfaces, see Bernardi et al. (1994). It was then used in partitioned FSI simulations with standard discretizations of the underlying BVPs in de Boer et al. (2008) and Klöppel et al. (2011) for coupling the underlying physics between the fluid and structural subdomains. Moreover, a special mortar formulation was presented in De Lorenzis et al. (2012) in the context of contact mechanics. The extension of the mortar method for FSI simulations involving isogeometric structural discretizations and the Variational Multiscale (VMS) stabilized FEM (Codina, 2001; Bazilevs et al., 2007) for the fluid discretization was presented in Bazilevs et al. (2012) and denoted as L2-projection. The methodology of the present work bases its fundamentals on this aforementioned L2projection. Moreover, this study details a framework for computing the mortar transformation matrices in an optimal way. Particularly, the presented isogeometric mortar-based mapping method deals with highly diverse, non-matching NURBSbased parametrizations stemming from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and low-order discretizations of the common interface. Additionally, the latter approach is also used in the context of the Exact Coupling Layer (ECL) method, which can be used for smoothing fields transformed between two low-order discretizations of the common interface through the NURBS-parametrized model of the exact interface description in terms of CAD. As detailed in Wang et al. (2016) the mortar method is superior to the other aforementioned mapping methods in terms of accuracy and consistency for the transformation of fields across non-matching discretizations with highly diverse mesh densities. Additionally, since the geometries of the computational models are generated in CAD software, it is highly efficient to use IGA, avoiding the time-consuming mesh generation step which is required in standard finite element methods. It is concluded that the most suitable method for transferring fields between a low-order discretized and a NURBS parametrized surface is the mortar-based method. Besides the aforementioned advantages, another main reason is that the Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) of the isogeometrically discretized field(s) lie on the Control Points (CPs). Thus, they do not represent physically relevant values since the CPs do not necessarily interpolate the geometry (Cottrell et al., 2009). This renders nearest neighbor or nearest element methods inappropriate. The isogeometric mortar-based mapping method naturally allows a two-fold strategy: It can be used in a coupled FSI scenario when the structural BVP is discretized using IGA (Breitenberger et al., 2015; Philipp et al., 2016; Wüchner et al., 2018) or it can be used to smooth fields when transformed from one low-order discretization (e.g., FEM) to another (e.g., FVM) taking advantage of the high-order nature and smoothness that the NURBS basis functions offer. Therefore, in the latter case the interface can be exactly represented in terms of NURBS, while the transformation of the interface fields can be done through this surface, denoted as the Exact Coupling Layer (ECL).  The paper is organized as follows: Firstly, the numerical methodology is detailed. The membrane BVP is briefly introduced along with a short discussion on the NURBS basis functions and the NURBS-based IGA spatial discretization  \\x0cA. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

Continuum mechanics of thin-walled structures: Mid-surface reduction and membrane stress state (Apostolatos, 2019).  of the underlying variational form. This section is complemented with the time discretization of the structural semidiscretized weak form. Then, a short description of the solution of the fluid problem is given. The Navier--Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid are written in an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) frame of reference and discretized using finite volumes. In case of turbulent flows, the LES technique is applied. Subsequently, the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method is introduced along with the employed assumptions and implementation aspects. The theoretical part is concluded by introducing the FSI solution approach including the residual energy computation associated with the coupling interface. For the assessment of the proposed methodology, three examples are chosen. The first one is the lid-driven cavity FSI benchmark proposed by Wall (1999). It is used for validation purposes, since the flow is laminar and the geometry simple. Then, an air-inflated hemisphere exposed to a turbulent boundary layer is investigated in order to demonstrate the applicability of the enhanced methodology for problems of physical relevance. Experimental and numerical reference data allow a direct comparison. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the influence of the FSI interface representation on the fluid solution, a significantly larger and time-invariant deformation is imposed to the hemispherical membrane. Finite element discretizations of different resolution for the deformed shape are subsequently considered as well as a NURBS parametrization. The standard mortar-based mapping method is used for the finite element discretizations, whereas the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method is employed for the NURBS-parametrized deformed shape. The results highlight the importance of the accurate interface representation in FSI simulations in terms of accuracy. Lastly, the computational costs related to the proposed methodology, particularly for the description of the FSI interface, are evaluated.  2. Numerical methodology  The numerical simulation methodology is based on a strong and efficient coupling scheme especially developed for fluid--structure interaction (FSI) problems including thin-walled structures within laminar or turbulent flows. The method relies on a partitioned coupling procedure. Thus, the structural and the fluid problems are solved separately. Since the details concerning the fluid part and the FSI coupling are included in Breuer et al. (2012) and corresponding validation studies can be found in De Nayer et al. (2014) and De Nayer and Breuer (2014), these parts are kept short. Herein, the focus is put on the isogeometric description of the membrane structure and on the isogeometric FSI mapping strategy.  2.1. Computational structural dynamics of membranes  In the following the basic equations governing the computational structural dynamics of membranes are detailed. Accordingly, this section starts with the continuum mechanics of membranes, continues with the isogeometric spatial semi-discretization and complemented with the time discretization using the Newmark scheme.  2.1.1. Continuum mechanics of membranes  Within this study, the interest concerning Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) is focused on so-called thin-walled structures whose mechanics are governed by the membrane theory (Apostolatos et al., 2019). Subsequently, let S : ˆΩ → Ω be a surface in 3D, where ˆΩ ⊂ R2 and Ω ⊂ R3 are its parametric and physical images, respectively. The domain ˆΩ is also known as the parametric image of the physical domain Ω. The parametric coordinates θ1 and θ2 are defined along the surface, whereas θ3 is chosen in the direction normal to the surface such that θ3 ∈ [−ts/2, ts/2]. Here, ts represents the thickness of the actual structure and is considered constant. Therefore, the domain Ω consists of all material points X which have a parametric image in ˆΩ through S, that is, X = S (θ1, θ2). The CSD problem is then characterized by the unknown displacement field d in a total Lagrangian description of the motion, meaning that the underlying stresses and strains are defined with respect to the initial undeformed configuration. In this way, the curvilinear space is bent  \\x0c372  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U. Bletzinger et al. / Journal of Fluids and Structures 86 (2019) 368--399  on the physical space following the deformation of the structure. The curvilinear base vectors on the surface Ω may be constructed (Basar and Krätzig, 1985) as follows,  Aα =  A3 =  ∂S ∂θα  ,  1 ∥A1 × A2∥2  A1 × A2 .  (1a)  (1b)  The displacement field can be defined in either the Cartesian or the aforementioned curvilinear space:  α  d = d0  i ei = d i , ei and (d  Aα + d3 A3 . (2) α, d3) are the Cartesian components of the displacement field, the Cartesian base vectors and the In Eq. (2), d0 contravariant components of the displacement field, respectively. The base vectors of the current configuration aα and a3 are defined in a similar manner as Eq. (1) using the surface in the current configuration, that is, s : ˆΩ → Ωt . Herein Ωt represents the current configuration consisting of all material points x = X + d for which a parametric image through s exists, namely x = s (θ1, θ2) at a given time instance t. Concerning the kinematics, given the contravariant base vectors α on surface Ω, the nonlinear Green--Lagrange second-order strain tensor ε = εαβ A A is employed which is defined over the contravariant basis (Holzapfel, 2000), and whose covariant components read,  β α ⊗ A  εαβ =  1  2  (aαβ − Aαβ  ) ,  (3)  where Aαβ and aαβ stand for the components of the metric tensors of the reference and the current configuration, respectively,  Aαβ = Aα · Aβ , aαβ = aα · aβ .  (4a)  (4b)  It is important to note that the strains in Eq. (3) are assumed to be constant along the thickness thus allowing only in-plane strains, as typical for membrane structures. Within the thin structure assumption r/ts ≪ 20, r being the radius of curvature, the out-of-plane strain and stress components in the continuum, i.e., in θ3-direction, can be neglected. The stress--strain relations are established using the Saint-Venant--Kirchhoff material law. For a given fourth-order material tensor C = C  Aα ⊗ Aβ ⊗ Aγ ⊗ Aδ this relation reads:  αβγ δ  n = C : ε .  (5)  αβ  αβ  Herein, n = n Aα ⊗ Aβ stands for the 2nd Piola--Kirchhoff second-order stress resultant force tensor. The components of the stress resultant force tensor n are given as pre-integrated components of the actual stress tensor components , since the stresses are assumed to be constant across the S thickness (Bletzinger et al., 2005). The name stress resultant force tensor is herein used, since after the pre-integration n represents neither a stress nor a force for this kind of structures (Kiendl, 2011).  along the thickness (see Fig. 1), that is, n  αβ = ts S  αβ  αβ  Membrane structures in 3D typically require a tensile pre-stress field, herein represented by the second-order tensor n0, in order to withstand general external forces which have also a transversal component (Bletzinger and Ramm, 1999). In this way, the weak form of the dynamic equilibrium for membrane structures can be formulated as follows: Find the displacement field d such that,  ∫  Ω  δd · ρs ts  ¨d dΩ +  ∫  Ω  δd · cs ts  ˙d dΩ +  ∫  Ω  δε : (n + n0) dΩ =  ∫  Ω  δd · b dΩ ,  (6)  for all test displacement fields δd which fulfill the Dirichlet boundary conditions along a portion of the boundary Γd ⊂ ∂Ω. In Eq. (6), ˙d is the velocity, ¨d the acceleration, ρs the density and cs the damping coefficient of the structure. Preintegrated body forces and surface tractions are contained in vector b. However, in the present work the damping term is approximated using the Rayleigh damping approach in the discrete form of the problem as described in Section 2.1.3.  2.1.2. Spatial discretization using the isogeometric structural analysis  Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is a recent numerical method for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using the exact geometric information for the computational model (Hughes et al., 2005; Cottrell et al., 2009) as opposed to ‘‘standard’’ Finite Element Methods (FEMs), where the geometry of the computational model is typically approximated by lower-order polynomials. Herein, the Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)-based IGA is employed for the spatial discretization of the PDE describing the structural mechanics (Apostolatos et al., 2014, 2015). Thus, the geometric parametrization of the reference and the current configuration, S and s, respectively, is done using the NURBS basis functions.  In the following, Piegl and Tiller (2012) is closely followed for defining the NURBS and the B-Spline basis functions as i and mα being  well as the corresponding parametrically defined surfaces. Given two knot vectors Θ α = [ θ α  mα ], θ α  . . . θ α  1  \\x0cA. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

The two-dimensional B-Spline basis functions N p1,p2  , ∀ (θ1, θ2) ∈ ˆΩ ,  (θ1, θ2)  i,j  (7)  are then defined by the  where ˆΩ = [θ 1 , θ 1 m1 one-dimensional B-Spline basis functions N pα i  ] × [θ 2 1  , θ 2 m2  1  in Θ α as follows,  N p1,p2 i,j  (θ1, θ2) = N p1  i  (θ1) N p2  j  (θ2) , ∀ (θ1, θ2) ∈ ˆΩ ,  in θα-direction. The one-dimensional B-Spline  (8)  where pα stands for the polynomial order of B-Spline basis functions N pα i basis functions N pα i  ¯pα N i  (θα) =  are defined by means of the Cox--De Boor recursion formula (Piegl and Tiller, 2012), that is, θα − θ α i − θ α θ α i+¯pα i  θ α i+¯pα +1 θ α i+¯pα +1  (θα) , ∀θα ∈ Θ α  − θα − θ α i+1  ¯pα −1 N i  (θα) +  ¯pα −1 i+1  N  (9)  ¯pα are obtained by a recursive construction ¯pα = 0, . . . , pα. where ¯pα = 0, . . . , pα. Thus, B-Spline basis functions N i (θα) = 0 Additionally, for the piecewise constant basis functions it holds N 0 i elsewhere and the definition 0/0 = 0 is assumed in Eq. (9). The B-Spline and subsequently the NURBS basis functions attain C ∞-continuity within each knot span [θ i ] and C pα −kiα -continuity across knots θ i α represents the in Θ α. Given a set of Control Points (CPs) with the associated position vector ˆXi,j in the physical multiplicity of knots θ α space, the NURBS surface S : ˆΩ → Ω can be constructed as  (θα) = 1 for θα ∈ [θ α  ), while N 0  α, whereas ki  α, θ i+1 α  , θ α  i+1  i  i  i  S = ∑ (i,j)∈I  Rp1,p2 i,j  ˆXi,j ,  (10)  where I contains all pairs (i, j) with i = 1, . . . , n1, j = 1, . . . , n2 and nα = mα − pα − 1 being the number of basis functions along Θ α. Within NURBS-based IGA, the primal variable, herein the displacement field d, is approximated using the aforementioned NURBS basis functions. For simplicity, let the aforementioned pairs (i, j) ∈ I be sequentially sorted through a map (i, j) → k for all i = 1, . . . , n1 and j = 1, . . . , n2, where k = 1, . . . , n and n = n1n2. In this way, the approximation of the displacement field using NURBS reads,  d ≈  3n ∑  r=1  φ  r  ˆdr ,  (11)  r stands for the vector-valued NURBS basis functions, namely, φ  where φ ei with (k, i) = (⌈r/3⌉ , r − 3⌈r/3⌉ + 3) for all r = 1, . . . , 3n. In this way, each pairing of a two-dimensional scalar-valued NURBS basis function Rp1,p2 with a Cartesian base vector ei is associated to a two-dimensional vector-valued NURBS basis function φ r in the fashion r → (k, i), that is, 1 → (1, 1), 2 → (1, 2), 3 → (1, 3), 4 → (2, 1), etc. Additionally, ˆdr stands for the displacement of the ⌈r/3⌉-th CP along r − (3⌈r/3⌉ − 3)-Cartesian direction. Since the CPs do not interpolate the geometry, displacement components ˆdr have no direct physical meaning. By bringing the approximation given in Eq. (11) into the weak form of dynamic equilibrium defined by Eq. (6), the semi-discretized problem in terms of the dynamic residual vector ¯R reads,  k  k  r = Rp1,p2  ¯R( ˆd) = M  ¨ˆd + D [ˆd1 · · · ˆd3n  ˙ˆd + R( ˆd) − ˆFt , ]T  (12) ¨ˆd being the corresponding discrete vectors of the where ˆd = velocity and acceleration Degrees of Freedom (DOFs). Moreover, the components of the mass matrix M and the steady-state residual vector R are given by  stands for displacements of the CPs,  ˙ˆd and  Mij =  Ri =  ∫  Ω  ∫  Ω  ρs ts φ  i · φ  j dΩ ,  ∂ε ∂ ˆdi  : (n + n0) dΩ .  (13a)  (13b)  The damping matrix D is approximated using the Rayleigh approach and its corresponding definition is postponed to Section 2.1.3. Additionally, ˆFt in Eq. (12) stands for the external load vector at each time instance t. In this way the components of the steady-state stiffness matrix are as follows:  Kij =  ∂Ri ∂ ˆdj  ∫  =  ∂ε ∂ ˆdi  :  ∂n ∂ ˆdj  Ω  +  ∂ 2ε ∂ ˆdi∂ ˆdj  : (n + n0) dΩ .  (14)  \\x0c374  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U. Bletzinger et al. / Journal of Fluids and Structures 86 (2019) 368--399  2.1.3. Time-discretization  The Newmark method is applied for the time discretization of Eq. (12), as it is unconditionally stable and provides second-order accuracy (proven for linear problems). In this way, the time domain T is discretized into a finite number of time steps tˆn ∈ T. Furthermore, if ˆd (tˆn) = ˆdˆn is the discrete vector of DOFs at time step tˆn, given the Newmark parameters βn, γn ∈ R∗  + the following approximations are chosen (Newmark, 1959): ( 1 ¨ˆdˆn , 2  ˙ˆdˆn−1 + (∆t)2 − βn ˙ˆdˆn−1 + ∆t (1 − γn) ¨ˆdˆn−1 + ∆t γn  ) ¨ˆdˆn−1 + (∆t)2 βn ¨ˆdˆn ,  ˆdˆn = ˆdˆn−1 + ∆t ˙ˆdˆn = ¯R( ˆdˆn) = M  ¨ˆdˆn + D  ˙ˆdˆn + R( ˆdˆn) − ˆFˆn .  (15a)  (15b)  (15c)  The Newton--Raphson linearization of the nonlinear system of equations is employed resulting in a sequence of iterations,  ¯K( ˆdˆn,ˆi) ∆ˆi  ˆdˆn = − ¯R( ˆdˆn,ˆi) , (16) − ˆdˆn,ˆi, in the ˆi-th iteration. ¯K stands for the dynamic tangent where the solution increment is defined as ∆ˆi stiffness matrix whose entries are given in terms of the steady-state tangent stiffness matrix K, the mass and damping matrix components via  ˆdˆn = ˆdˆn,ˆi+1  ¯Kij( ˆdˆn,ˆi) =  (  =  ∂ ¯Ri ∂ ˆdj  1 βn (∆t)2  Mij +  )  Dij  γn βn∆t  + Kij( ˆdˆn,ˆi) .  (17)  As aforementioned, the computation of the damping matrix D is herein based on the Rayleigh damping approach (Clough and Penzien, 1993; Thomsen et al., 2000): Given the Rayleigh damping parameters αr, βr ∈ R∗ +, D is approximated as follows  D = αr M + βr K  )  ( ˆd0,0  ,  (18)  where ˆd0,0 stands for the initial condition of the displacement DOFs. Thus, the damping matrix is computed using the initial linear stiffness matrix of the structure.  2.2. Computational fluid dynamics  In order to predict the flow field, the three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid are solved based on a finite volume discretization, which is second-order accurate in space and time. Several methods are available to solve the pressure--velocity coupling problem: In case of a laminar flow a standard implicit SIMPLE scheme can be applied. However, when the flow becomes turbulent, a semi-implicit predictor--corrector scheme (projection method), which is more appropriate for the large-eddy simulation (LES) technique, is preferred (Breuer et al., 2012). The large scales of the turbulent flow are resolved directly, whereas the small scales are modeled by a subgrid-scale (SGS) model such as the standard Smagorinsky model (1963). In order to reasonably predict the flow applying LES, an appropriate representation of the inflow boundary conditions is required (Wood et al., 2016; Breuer, 2018). In the present LES framework turbulent perturbations mimicking the reality are synthetically generated by an inflow generator based on the digital filter concept of Klein et al. (2003). These data are then injected as source terms inside the domain (Schmidt and Breuer (2017), De Nayer et al. (2018b) and Breuer (2018)).  In this study, both the pressure and the shear stresses of the fluid are taken into account along the FSI interface for the computation of the fluid tractions. Based on the pressure p, the velocity u and the dynamic viscosity µ of the fluid, the fluid tractions are given by t = −p en + µ en · ∇su .  (19) In Eq. (19), en and ∇s = 1/2(∇ + ∇T) stand for the unit vector normal to the FSI surface and the symmetric gradient tensor, respectively.  In case of FSI applications the temporally varying domain is taken into account by the Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian (ALE) formulation. Since the grid is body-fitted, a mesh adaption method is necessary: A very fast algebraic technique relying on a combination of linear and transfinite interpolations (TFI) is employed for FSI problems undergoing small displacements and deformations (Thompson et al., 1985). In the context of larger displacements a hybrid method especially developed for FSI-LES problems and block-structured grids (Sen et al., 2017) is preferred. For further details concerning the CFD technique used, the reader is referred to the cited references.  2.3. Isogeometric mortar-based mapping  In this section the isogeometric mortar-based mapping (Bazilevs et al., 2012) for field transformations between nonmatching discretizations which share a common interface is introduced. The proposed methodology is an extension of  \\x0cA. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U. Bletzinger et al. / Journal of Fluids and Structures 86 (2019) 368--399  375  Fig. 2. Isogeometric mortar-based mapping: Problem definition.  Fig. 3. Isogeometric mortar-based mapping: Projection of low-order elements onto NURBS-based CAD model.  the mortar-based mapping method suggested in Wang et al. (2016) involving two low-order faceted discretizations to account also for isogeometric discretizations. Let the surface Ω be modeled using the NURBS basis functions as introduced in Section 2.1.2 with the parametrization S (see Fig. 2(a) for example). Furthermore, let Ωh be a low-order faceted approximation of Ω with parametrization Sh (see Fig. 2(b)). In the present work, Ω is linked to the wet surface of the membrane and Ωh to the fluid FSI interface. Since in the current study the fluid domain is discretized using finite volumes on block-structured grids (see Section 4), the surface Ωh is represented by quadrilaterals. These can be split into triangles in order to describe Ωh by a low-order representation based on linear triangles. The underlying parametrization of the surface Ωh is done using the standard FE basis functions meaning that  Sh =  nh∑  i=1  Ni Xi ,  (20)  where Ni, Xi and nh stand for the low-order basis functions (linear for triangles or bilinear for quadrilaterals), the corresponding set of nodal coordinates and the total number of nodes in the low-order discretization Ωh, respectively. In this way, given an isogeometrically discretized vector field q defined in Ω, which may represent either the interface displacement or traction field, a piecewise linear (or bilinear) vector field qh on Ωh is sought such that,  qh = arg min  ¯qh∈L2(Ω)  \\ued79 \\ued79q − ¯qh\\ued79  \\ued790,Ω  ,  (21)  where L2 (Ω) stands for the space of all square integrable vector functions in Ω and ∥ • ∥0,Ω defined by  1 is its corresponding norm  ∥q∥0,Ω =  ) 1  2  q · q dΩ  (∫  Ω  ,  for all q ∈ L2 (Ω) .  (22)  1 Symbol • stands for an arbitrary variable.  \\x0c376  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U. Bletzinger et al. / Journal of Fluids and Structures 86 (2019) 368--399  A common interface between the domains Ω and Ωh has to be established for the problem defined in Eq. (21) to be meaningful. Therefore, the exact representation of surface Ω by means of NURBS is herein employed as the common integration area and subsequently the low-order surface discretization Ωh is mapped onto Ω. Consider the triangle Xi-XjXk in Ωh (see Fig. 2(b)). Each of its nodes is projected onto Ω using a Newton--Raphson scheme, finding the corresponding 2), ˆθj = ( ˆθ j local parameters of its vertices in ˆΩ, namely, ˆθi = ( ˆθ i 2 ), respectively (see Fig. 3(a)). The nodes are assumed to be linearly connected in ˆΩ forming the projection of the specific triangle onto Ω. Subsequently, the image of the triangle transferred back to the physical space is depicted in Fig. 3(b) through its projected vertices Xp i , Xp = S(ˆθi) stands for the corresponding geometric map. Having defined the common interface and Xp between the domains of the fields q and qh, the weak form of the problem in Eq. (21) states: Given a field q ∈ L2 (Ω), find a field qh ∈ L2 (Ωh) such that,  k , respectively, where Xp  2) and ˆθk = ( ˆθ k  , ˆθ k  , ˆθ j  , ˆθ i  1  1  1  j  i  ∫  Ω  δqh · qh dΩ =  ∫  Ω  δqh · q dΩ ,  for all δqh ∈ L2 (Ωh) .  (23)  Since the fields q and qh are discretized by using isogeometric and ‘‘standard’’ finite element basis functions in Ω and Ωh, respectively, they can be expressed as  3n ∑  r=1 3nh∑  q =  qh =  φ  r ˆqr ,  φh r  ˆqh r  ,  (24a)  (24b)  r=1 = Nk ei (with k = 1, . . . , nh,  where φh i = 1, . . . , 3 and r is defined as in Section 2.1.2) are the standard vectorr values linear or bilinear basis functions. The definition of the DOFs is similar to the isogeometric discretization of the displacement field in Section 2.1.2. Herein, ˆdi and ˆdh i are the discrete values of the fields defined on each CP and each node, respectively. This leads to the matrix form of the isogeometric mortar-based mapping, namely,  ˆqh = (Cnn)−1  Cnr ˆq ,  (25)  where ˆqh = [ˆqh 1 isogeometric discretization, respectively. The entries of the mortar matrices Cnn and Cnr in Eq. (25) are then given by  ]T and ˆq = [ˆq1 . . . ˆq3n]T stand for the discrete vectors of DOFs for the finite element and the  . . . ˆqh  3nh  ij = C nn  ij = C nr  ∫  Ω  ∫  Ω  i · φh φh  j dΩ ,  i · φ φh  j dΩ .  (26a)  (26b)  On the other hand, if the field qh is given and the isogeometric field q is sought, then the problem in Eq. (23) reverses and the weak form accordingly becomes: Given a field qh ∈ L2 (Ωh), find a field q ∈ L2 (Ω) ∪ L2 (Γd) such that,  ∫  Ω  δq · q dΩ +  ∫  Γd  ¯α δq · q dΓ =  ∫  Ω  δq · qh dΩ ,  for all δq ∈ L2 (Ω) ∪ L2 (Γd) .  (27)  In Eq. (27) the field q is weakly set to zero along the boundary Γd by means of the penalty method using a penalty parameter ¯α : Γd → R. The latter is optional and can be selectively used in case a fixed value of the mapped field along the boundary is desired. Since the considered patches are untrimmed, it is possible herein to enforce the constraint along Γd strongly. However, the weak enforcement is herein chosen, since it is more general and can be later on extended to account also for trimmed patches. In addition, the corresponding admissible space does not have to comply with the Dirichlet boundary conditions thus enabling a better approximation of the mapped field in the domain Ω (Babuska, 1973). Accordingly, the discrete system of equations becomes,  ˆq = (Crr)−1  Crn ˆqh ,  where the entries of the underlying matrices accordingly read  ij = C rr  ∫  Ω  φ  ∫  ¯α φ  j dΩ +  i · φ  j dΓ ,  ij = C nr C rn  ji =  φ  i · φh  Γd j dΩ .  i · φ ∫  Ω  (28)  (29a)  (29b)  Notably, Cnn and Crr are square, symmetric and positive definite matrices rendering the mortar-based mapping well-posed. In addition, these matrices are sparse and thus the employed linear solvers benefit in terms of storage and efficiency. Moreover, since no coupling between the three Cartesian directions appears in these matrices, they can be reduced to  \\x0cA. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

Sequential isogeometric mortar-based mapping via the Exact Coupling Layer (ECL).  account for each Cartesian direction separately, making the procedure even more efficient. The evaluation of the integrals in Eqs. (26) and (29) over Ω is performed at the subdomains Ωi ⊂ Ω with i = 1, . . . , nt ∈ N (Fig. 3(a)) which emerge when clipping the projection of the low-order elements (into the NURBS parameter space) with the knots of the NURBS parametrization (as depicted in Fig. 3(a)). For this purpose, the Gauss integration method is used on a triangulation of each Ωi, where given a corresponding set of Gauss points (θ g,j 2,i ) in the NURBS parametric space ˆΩi (Fig. 3(b)) of each 1,i Ωi and Gauss weights wg,j  i with j = 1, . . . , ng  i one has,  , θ g,j  ∫  Ω  • dΩ =  nt∑  ∫  i=1  Ωi  • dΩ =  nt∑  ∫  i=1  ˆΩi  • ∥A3∥2 d ˆΩ =  nt∑  g  n  i∑  i=1  j=1  (• ∥A3∥2  )|  (θ g,j 1,i  ,θ g,j 2,i )  wg,j i  .  (30)  This ensures that the basis function products reach C ∞-continuity within the integration subdomains. The low-order finite element basis functions are then computed at each Gauss point with respect to the shape of the low-order element in the NURBS parametric space. This means that a one-to-one correspondence between the original and the projected low-order elements is established.  As already mentioned in the introduction, the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method can also be used for smoothing the transformed fields taking advantage of the arbitrarily smooth high-order NURBS basis functions introduced in Eq. (7). This methodology is especially useful when fields from a coarsely discretized surface are mapped onto a finely discretized surface: To be more specific, let field qh coarse be defined by a coarse low-order discretization and that its transformation onto a field qh fine defined on a fine low-order discretization is sought. This can be realized by establishing the transformation via the smooth NURBS-based CAD model of the underlying geometry, the so-called Exact Coupling Layer (ECL): The isogeometric mortar-based mapping can be applied from the coarse low-order discretization onto the CAD surface and from the CAD surface onto the fine low-order discretization sequentially, that is,  fine = qh  ((Crr)−1  Crn) ((Cnn)−1  Cnr)  qh coarse  .  (31)  In this way, the artificial geometric roughness defining the coarse low-order discretization is smoothed through the ECL, thus enabling a smooth field representation on the fine low-order discretization (see Fig. 4). Typically, the coarse loworder discretization is associated with the structural discretization and the fine low-order discretization with the fluid FSI interface mesh. Thus, naturally the displacement field is transformed from the structural discretization to the fluid FSI interface mesh where the smoothing through the ECL proves highly beneficial, since kinks which may naturally occur on the displaced structural mesh are not transferred to the fluid FSI interface. Within this work, the transformation of the traction field from the fluid FSI interface to the structural mesh is also filtered through the ECL within the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method so that the methodology is kept consistent in both mapping directions.  2.4. FSI coupling  Based on the aforementioned mapping methodology, the structural displacement can be transformed to the fluid side and vice versa the fluid tractions can be transformed from the fluid FSI interface onto the structural side. Since the pressure and the velocity fields are defined at the cell center in the CFD problem, the fluid tractions (see Eq. (19)) are also computed at the center of the cell face which is associated with the fluid FSI interface. Since the traction is considered constant in each of these faces, it is discontinuous across neighboring faces along the fluid FSI interface. Thus, the traction vector at each node of the fluid FSI interface is linearly averaged from the neighboring elements. Then, a bilinear finite element interpolant at each face of the fluid FSI interface is applied to construct a continuous traction field. This is used within the proposed mortar-based mapping method in Section 2.3 to transform the tractions from the fluid to the structural FSI interface. Lastly, the consistent load vector of the corresponding fluid tractions on the structural FSI interface (which is a part of vector b in Eq. (6)) is constructed by integrating the transformed fluid tractions along the structural FSI interface. In order to couple both the structural and fluid problems in time and thus to solve the coupled FSI problem, the present numerical methodology relies on a standard partitioned approach. If the implicit SIMPLE scheme (in case of laminar flows) is applied on the fluid side, the FSI coupling is carried out by an implicit iterative coupling strategy similar to the one described by Glück et al. (2003). With the semi-implicit predictor--corrector method used for the large-eddy simulations in case of turbulent flows, the adapted semi-implicit iterative FSI coupling published in Breuer et al. (2012) is preferred, since it significantly reduces the CPU-time.  \\x0c378  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U. Bletzinger et al. / Journal of Fluids and Structures 86 (2019) 368--399  Both strategies are based on one or several field exchange cycles (displacements and tractions) between the structural and the fluid problems during one time step which are called FSI-subiterations. In case of applications with low addedmass effect, where the ratio of the structural density to the fluid density is large, only one FSI-subiteration is necessary: The structural and the fluid problems are successively solved once per time step. In that case the procedure is called loose or explicit coupling scheme (Causin et al., 2005; Farhat et al., 2006; Wüchner et al., 2007). On the contrary, i.e., in case of a non-negligible added-mass effect, several FSI-subiterations are required to ensure the equilibrium along the FSI interface. The FSI-coupling is then denoted as strong or implicit coupling scheme. During this FSI-subcycle an underrelaxation of one of the fields (displacements or tractions) is often necessary to guarantee the FSI convergence in case of an unfavorable added-mass. The relaxation factor can be constant or dynamically computed by the Aitken algorithm (Aitken, 1926). The dynamically updated relaxation factor can considerably speed-up the FSI convergence (Mok, 2001). The coupled solution is considered converged if the following FSI criterion is reached: The 2-norm of the displacement difference2 between two FSI-subiterations (index ˆk) normalized by the 2-norm of the change in the displacements between the current and the last time step (index ˆn) drops below a predefined limit ϵFSI, i.e.,  ∥2  < ϵFSI .  − ˆdˆn,ˆk−1 |ΩFSI − ˆdˆn−1 |ΩFSI ∥2 and ˆdˆn−1 |ΩFSI  ∥ ˆdˆn,ˆk |ΩFSI ∥ ˆdˆn,ˆk |ΩFSI where ˆdˆn,ˆk |ΩFSI stand for the FSI interface displacement DOFs at the ˆk-th coupling iteration at time tˆn and the converged displacement DOFs along the FSI interface ΩFSI at time step tˆn−1, respectively. Moreover, the index ˆi of the Newton--Raphson iteration is herein omitted since the aforementioned displacement DOFs of the converged nonlinear structural solution are considered. Typically, ϵFSI is set to 10−6 and the procedure needs about 5 FSI-subiterations to converge up to this accuracy.  (32)  The important role of the energy transfer within partitioned FSI simulations has been shown in Piperno and Farhat (2001) and Dervieux et al. (2010) among others. Therefore, this matter is also investigated herein. Let WΩFSI be the work done by the fluid forces on the moving FSI interface ΩFSI at a given time. This is defined as follows,  WΩFSI  =  ∫  ΩFSI  t · d dΩ ,  (33)  where t and d stand for the traction and displacement fields along the FSI interface ΩFSI at a given time defined on either the fluid or the structural subdomain. The superscript •(f) or •(s) is accordingly used. Since in this study the traction and the displacement fields are transformed using the mortar-based mapping method from one interface to the other (see Section 2.3), their discrete representations (see Eq. (24)) can be substituted in Eq. (33). In the case when FVM and IGA are used for the discretization of the fluid and structural fields, the following expressions for the interface work are obtained:  W (f) ΩFSI W (s) ΩFSI  = (ˆt(f))T = (ˆt(s))T  Cnn ˆd(f) , Crr ˆd(s) .  (34a)  (34b)  If the ECL is applied, the structure is discretized by FEM and thus W (s) is computed using Eq. (34a) using the ΩFSI corresponding structural Cnn matrix. The residual interface energy EΩFSI is defined by the difference between the structural and the fluid interface work:  EΩFSI  = W (s) ΩFSI  − W (f) ΩFSI  .  (35)  3. Lid-driven cavity with a flexible membrane attached at its bottom  3.1. Case setup  The FSI cavity benchmark is employed for the evaluation of the proposed methodology as it offers a simple 2D geometry while relatively large deformations are allowed. This case was initially proposed by Wall (1999) and Mok (2001) and then used by many other groups as benchmark (see, e.g., Gerbeau and Vidrascu, 2003; Kassiotis et al., 2011). It involves a square domain where the top wall is impermeable and moving with a given time-dependent cosinusoidal velocity ui. The two impermeable side-walls are fixed, while a flexible impermeable membrane is attached at the bottom (see Fig. 5(a)). A small area on the left and the right side-walls is chosen as inlet and outlet, respectively. The previously described numerical methodology is applied combining a strong FSI coupling strategy with an FSI convergence criterion of ϵFSI = 10−6. Since the Reynolds number in the fluid domain does not exceed 200, the flow is considered as laminar and no turbulence model is applied. The kinematic viscosity of the fluid is set to 10−2 m2/s. A membrane model is used for the flexible structure with Young’s modulus E = 250 Pa, Poisson’s ratio ν = 0, density ρs = 500 kg/m3 and thickness ts = 2 × 10−3 m.  2 The 2-norm of a discrete vector of DOFs is equal to the square root of the sum of its squared components.  \\x0cA.

FSI cavity benchmark: Refinement study using the time displacement curves of a node in the middle of the flexible membrane (FSI simulation with 100 structural FEM elements).  Based on a preliminary study taking different time steps into account (see Fig. 6(a)), the finally applied time step size is ∆t = 10−2 s for both the fluid and structural problems. To ensure the spatial grid independency of the fluid solution, two equidistant Cartesian fluid grid (30 × 30 and 50 × 50 control volumes (CVs)) were tested (see Fig. 6(b)). The 30 × 30 fluid mesh (see Fig. 5(b)) is found to be sufficient. For the structure multiple discretizations of the flexible membrane are considered. These discretizations involve standard quadrilateral finite element and isogeometric discretizations. Due to the simplicity of the geometry of the membrane, a B-Spline patch is chosen for the isogeometric discretization. The B-Spline surface is subsequently also used as the Exact Coupling Layer: The tractions mapped from the fluid to the structural domain as well as the displacements mapped from the structural to the fluid domain are filtered through the B-Spline surface, thus smoothing the underlying vector fields. The forthcoming simulations involve standard C 0-continuous FEM with 6 elements with and without the ECL and IGA with 10 C 1-continuous elements. The latter NURBS parametrization, that is the 10 C 1-continuous elements, is also employed for modeling the ECL. As a reference solution, the time-dependent solution of the problem using 100 quadrilateral equidistant finite elements for the discretization of the flexible membrane is employed using the standard mortar-based mapping method.  3.2. Results  A qualitative comparison of the streamlines and the deformation of the membrane at t = 19 s simulation time, where the maximum of the displacement in the periodic FSI cycle is reached, is shown in Fig. 7. Accordingly, the time history of the displacements of the membrane’s mid-point is shown in Fig. 8(a) for the reference data and the solution obtained by using 10 biquadratic C 1-continuous isogeometric elements. Both qualitatively and quantitatively the comparison shows a very good agreement between both simulations, i.e., when using IGA and the reference finite element mesh for the structural discretization. Furthermore, the simulation results coincide with the results of Kassiotis et al. (2011). Then, the  \\x0c380  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

FSI cavity benchmark: Streamlines corresponding to the FSI simulation with the reference mesh (100 quadrilateral membrane finite elements) and with IGA single patch mesh (10 biquadratic C 1-continuous isogeometric membrane elements) at time t = 19 s.  Exact Coupling Layer (ECL) concept is exploited by using a very coarse structural finite element mesh consisting of only 6 elements, while the previously employed isogeometric discretization is used as the Exact Coupling Layer. Note that the ECL is used for both displacement and traction field transformations in order to keep the framework consistent, i.e., the same methodology in both transformation directions. Fig. 9 provides a qualitative comparison between the streamlines and the corresponding deformation of the fluid interface mesh without and with the application of the Exact Coupling Layer. Note that the faceted interface visible in Fig. 9(a) is defined on the fluid FSI interface and is caused by the low resolution of the FEM structural mesh generating an artificial roughness at the fluid FSI interface. The time history of the displacements at the membrane’s mid-point and that of the fluid interface without and with the Exact Coupling Layer are shown in Fig. 8(b). Subsequently, they are compared against the reference solution. Since the structure is discretized with only 6 elements, both solutions (FEM 6 elements without and with ECL) are deviating from the reference solution, as expected. However, they produce similar results. The latter demonstrates that the Exact Coupling Layer concept can be used for appropriately smoothing the solution when transferred from one low-order discretized interface to another, thus eliminating artificial interface roughness triggering spurious flow field solutions (see Section 5.1). Additionally, a quantitative convergence evaluation of the mapping results is presented. The displacement field d defined on the B-Spline surface at t = 19 s of the FSI simulation is mapped using Eq. (25) onto the fluid FSI interface, while the fluid FSI interface is gradually refined using an equidistant finite element mesh (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 finite elements). Similarly, the traction field t defined over the fluid interface at the same time of the FSI simulation is mapped using Eq. (28) onto the NURBS patch, while this NURBS patch is also uniformly refined (24, 48, 192, 384, 768 and 1536 equidistant knots) using piecewise C 1-continuous quadratic elements in the length direction, whereas one linear element in the width direction is used, since the problem is two-dimensional and effects in the width direction need to be suppressed. The results are shown in Fig. 10, where h stands for either the minimum finite element edge size in the considered finite element or the square root of the minimum element area size found in the isogeometric discretization, which is the area of the smallest knot span in the Cartesian space. A uniform convergence to the target field can be observed with a convergence of second-order for both mapping transformations (displacements and tractions). The target displacement and traction fields defined over the NURBS patch and the fluid interface, respectively, at t = 19 s and the displacement and traction fields mapped onto the fluid FSI interface and the NURBS patch, respectively, are depicted in Fig. 11 for a given refinement level. The original mesh has 30 equidistant elements, so that the mapping is comparable with the one used for the FSI cavity benchmark (the CFD finite volume mesh has 30 × 30 CVs). An excellent agreement can be observed which is also supported by the corresponding convergence graphs.  The last step is to evaluate the residual energy at the interface EΩFSI with the help of Eq. (35) (see Fig. 12). For the four different setups the absolute value of the residual energy at each time step starts from zero and increases during the initialization phase. Then, in the periodic phase, it stays below 10−5 N m for FEM-6 and even below 10−9 N m for FEM-100, IGA and FEM-6 with ECL. These errors are negligible compared to the values of the work of the fluid forces at the FSI interface WΩFSI (between 3 × 10−3 N m and 5 × 10−3 N m). This demonstrates that a better representation of the FSI interface with the presented isogeometric mortar mapping leads to lower residual energies and thus lower errors at this coupling interface. Although EΩFSI is not equal to zero as it would be in an exactly energy-conservative scheme, the corresponding error remains small during the simulation.  Relying on the simple lid-driven cavity case by Mok (2001), the numerical FSI methodology presented in Section 2 is  therefore successfully validated.  \\x0cA. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

Air-inflated flexible hemisphere in turbulent flow  In order to test the numerical FSI methodology including the isogeometric analysis described in Section 2, the wallmounted air-inflated membrane immersed in a turbulent boundary layer (Wood et al., 2018; De Nayer et al., 2018a,c) is studied. In comparison with the rather simple lid-driven cavity test case the geometry is three-dimensional, the flow  \\x0c382  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

Fig. 13 depicts the geometry in detail and Table 1 summarizes the operating conditions. Among the three cases considered in Wood et al. (2018) the case with the highest Reynolds number Re = D U∞ ρair/µair = 100,000 is selected, since the largest displacements and the strongest fluctuations of the membrane are observed for this setup. For more details concerning the choice of the material, the determination of the material parameters and the choice of the characteristics of the incoming boundary layer and the inner pressure, refer to Wood et al. (2018). The designation of the Cartesian axes as X1-X2-X3 used in the prequel for the governing equations in continuum mechanics is shifted to x-y-z in the sequel since that is more common in computational fluid dynamics.  4.1.

Numerical results of the same FSI problem but computed with a ‘‘standard’’ finite element membrane discretization are used in the present investigation for comparison and the corresponding simulation is abbreviated with FSI-LES-FEM. The setup of the FSI-LES-FEM simulation with 1926 constant strain triangle elements can be found in De Nayer et al. (2018a).  4.1.1. Single patch isogeometric modeling of the flexible hemisphere  Although the hemispherical shape of the membrane belongs to the category of generic shapes, which is also a synclastic surface, its modeling using NURBS results in parametrizations which attain singularities either along its boundary or at its center. Furthermore, there may also exist parametric directions along which the continuity drops to C 0. In order to obtain a hemispherical shape which is at least C 1-continuous in its interior, the Updated Reference Strategy (URS) form-finding method is employed (see Bletzinger and Ramm (1999), Wüchner and Bletzinger (2005) and Apostolatos et al. (2018) for more information). Given the pressure difference of magnitude ∆pcal = 43 Pa between the inner and the outer domain (based on this value and without a flow field the structure reaches an almost hemispherical shape in the calibration phase of the experiments), the membrane thickness ts and the diameter of the hemisphere D, the calibration pre-stress of the membrane for an equilibrium in an almost hemispherical configuration is given by Barlow’s formula  ncal =  ∆pcal D 4 ts  = 9772.3 Pa .  (36)  The setting of the form-finding problem can be seen in Fig. 14(a). The parametrization with four singularities at the Dirichlet boundary Γd is chosen. The corresponding determinant of the geometrical Jacobian is shown in Fig. 14(b). Starting from a flat reference configuration for the form-finding problem, a series of form-finding steps according to the URS algorithm are carried out applying the constant pressure difference and the pre-stress ncal as well as the zero displacement field along Γd.  For the form-finding analysis, three different isogeometric discretizations of the flat circular plate are chosen, one with 144 biquadratic elements, one with 625 biquadratic elements and one with 625 bicubic elements. The results of the form-finding analysis for the three aforementioned configurations are represented in Fig. 15, respectively. The difference  \\x0c384  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U. Bletzinger et al. / Journal of Fluids and Structures 86 (2019) 368--399  of the form-found shape to the exact hemispherical shape is quantified using the following error measure,  e = (Xh − X) · A3 ,  (37)  where Xh, X and A3 stand for all material points of the form-found geometry, all material points of the exact hemisphere and the outward normal to the exact hemisphere, respectively. The isogeometric discretizations with 625 elements3 are one order of magnitude more accurate than the coarser parametrization.  In Appendix the three different isogeometric discretizations are evaluated based on a steady and a dynamic pure structural case. In these pure CSD cases and in the last FSI application described below, the initial pre-stress has to be reduced to the value nmembrane = 7794.5 Pa as assigned in the FEM model of De Nayer et al. (2018a), since the gravitational forces are taken into account by means of a dead load. Furthermore, the silicone rubber used in the experiments is characterized by the St. Venant--Kirchhoff material model. Its two parameters, the Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio are set to the experimentally evaluated values Esilicone = 7 × 105 Pa and νsilicone ≈ 0.45, respectively. Based on this setup, the steady and dynamic pure CSD cases in Appendix are used to determine the influence of the grid resolution. It is found that the grid with 625 biquadratic elements is the best compromise between accuracy and CPU consumption. Therefore, it is used in the following FSI study.  For the FSI case described in Wood et al. (2018), the inner pressure is maintained constant in the experiment. This is modeled in the CSD solver by means of a follower pressure load acting on each element surface (Schweizerhof and Ramm, 1984). The pressure difference between the inner and outer domain is set to ∆pFSI = ∆pcal.  The CSD solver applies the standard second-order Newmark scheme with a dimensionless time step ∆t ∗ = ∆t U∞ / D = 3.317 × 10−5. This small value is driven by the fluid solver, since both solvers must have the same time step size within the employed solution approach. In addition, the Rayleigh damping, necessary for modeling the structural damping of the hemisphere, is used. The mass- and stiffness-proportional parameters are set to αr = 17.47 and βr = 1.89 × 10−4, as determined in De Nayer et al. (2018a).  4.1.2. Large-eddy simulation of the flow  The turbulent flow is predicted by the large-eddy simulation technique applying the standard Smagorinsky subgridscale model with Cs = 0.1 and Van Driest damping as used in the FSI-LES-FEM simulation of De Nayer et al. (2018a). The flow is only solved in the outer domain, since the constant inner pressure is modeled by a follower pressure load as mentioned above. The external CFD domain is a large hemispherical expansion with its origin at the center of the hemisphere and an outer diameter of 20 D. In De Nayer et al. (2018b) CFD results of the flow around the rigid hemisphere obtained on a fine grid with about 30 × 106 CVs and on a medium grid with about 4.3 × 106 CVs were compared. It shows that the medium grid provides sufficient accuracy and saves a huge amount of computational time. Therefore, this medium grid is selected for the present FSI simulation.  The boundary conditions are exactly the same as applied for the FSI-LES-FEM simulation. The bottom wall is a no-slip fixed wall and the flexible membrane is also considered as a no-slip smooth wall. The correct characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer (distributions, length and time scales) are imposed by turbulence data synthetically generated by an inflow generator. These inflow data are injected inside the domain at x/D = −1.5 by a source-term formulation (De Nayer et al., 2018b).  Concerning the spatial discretization, the convective fluxes are approximated by the flux blending method to stabilize the simulation: 5% first-order accurate upwind scheme is combined with 95% second-order accurate central scheme. The CFD grid and the explicit time integration technique used yield a small dimensionless time step size of ∆t ∗ = 3.317 × 10−5 to ensure stable simulations with CFL numbers below unity.  4.1.3. FSI setup  In order to couple the structural and fluid solvers and exchange data at the common interface, the FSI coupling described in Section 2.4 is selected. Since the ratio of the structural density to the fluid density is large (ρs/ρair ≈ 857), the added-mass effect is not overly pronounced in this case and therefore a loose FSI coupling scheme can be applied (Causin et al., 2005; Farhat et al., 2006).  Analogous to the FSI-LES-FEM simulation the fluid domain is initialized by a pure LES before starting to solve the FSI problem. Moreover, at the beginning of the FSI simulation the structure is stabilized by a higher Young’s modulus (7× 106 Pa) to ensure a stable coupled simulation. Then, Esilicone is decreased to its correct value of 7 × 105 Pa in a time interval of 5000 time steps.  In the following two additional simulations are considered and compared with FSI-LES-FEM: An FSI simulation with an isogeometric discretization of the hemisphere (FSI-LES-IGA) and an FSI simulation with a ‘‘standard’’ triangular FEM computational model (FEM 1926 used in De Nayer et al. (2018a)) for the hemisphere combined with ECL (FSI-LES-FEM with ECL). The isogeometric discretization with 625 biquadratic C 1-continuous elements (see Fig. 15(b)) is applied for the hemisphere and for the ECL. Concerning FSI-LES-IGA, the fluid mesh at the FSI interface and its projection on the NURBS hemisphere are shown in Fig. 16(a) and Fig. 16(b), respectively. Concerning FSI-LES-FEM with ECL, the structural mesh and its projection on the NURBS hemisphere are shown in Fig. 16(c) and Fig. 16(d), respectively. For the transformation of  3 An element in NURBS-based IGA is the knot span of the underlying NURBS parametrization.  \\x0cA. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

Both simulations are carried out on 40 processors for the CFD part, 1 processor for the CSD part and 1 processor for the coupling part.  4.2. Results  The coupled FSI problem of the turbulent flow around the flexible air-inflated membrane is investigated in detail, both experimentally by Wood et al. (2018) and numerically by De Nayer et al. (2018b). Fig. 17 depicts a snapshot of the flow field (pressure and vorticity magnitude) and the deformed membrane predicted by the FSI-LES-IGA simulation. The approaching turbulent boundary layer excites the membranous structure. The flow separates close to the apex of the hemisphere. The oscillations of the structure in this region are the result of the separation and roll-up of the shear layer arising from the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability. Different vortex shedding processes are found in the wake of the hemisphere: An asymmetric von Kármán vortex street irregularly alternating with an arc-type symmetric vortex shedding, both with different characteristic frequencies. Small vortices merging in the shear layer form medium-sized vortices which move downstream. The succession of the corresponding pressure fluctuations induces a series of indentations and elevations on the membrane. A wave of deformations is generated on the rear side due to the downward movement of the vortices. Furthermore, several eigenfrequencies of the hemispherical membrane are found in the experimental and numerical results.  In order to evaluate the turbulent flow around the flexible hemisphere predicted by the FSI-LES-IGA simulation, the results are averaged over a time interval of ∆T ∗ = 125. Fig. 18 compares the time-averaged deformation of the flexible hemisphere obtained by the FSI-LES-IGA simulation with the FSI-LES-FEM results (with and without ECL) and the experimental data. The comparison takes place at the symmetry plane y/D = 0 in the wake region, since this location is of major importance for the generation of the recirculation area. The flow deflected by the bluff body accelerates in the  \\x0c386  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U. Bletzinger et al. / Journal of Fluids and Structures 86 (2019) 368--399  Fig. 17.

It induces a low pressure zone on the top (see Fig. 17), i.e., a vertical lift force, leading to a vertical displacement of the membrane. The time-averaged deformation at the apex predicted by FSI-LES-FEM with and without ECL is in very good agreement with the experimental data, but the FSI-LES-IGA results exhibit an even better agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the shape of the FSI-LES-IGA deformations on the rear side tends towards the experimental data.

Then, they increase reaching a maximum and abruptly decrease to zero at the fixed boundary (ϕ = 0◦). Whereas the locations of the minimum and maximum of the predicted shape of S∗ x are similar to the z : A local peak present in the experimental data around ϕ = 70◦ does not experimental curve, a discrepancy appears for S∗ exist in the simulations, neither in the previous FSI-LES-FEM nor in the new FSI-LES-IGA results. The most visible difference between both simulation results is found for the amplitude of the standard deviations: The FSI-LES-IGA setup predicts lower values fitting better to the experiments in the lower part of the hemisphere. The simulation FSI-LES-FEM with ECL shows almost the same behavior as the FSI-LES-FEM simulation. This is somehow expected since the smoothing induced by ECL has no significant effect on an FSI interface under the current condition of small deformations. Nevertheless, the ECL produces the expected results, thus successfully demonstrating its application to real-world problems. Conclusively, all performed simulations produce satisfactory results compared to the experiment, thus demonstrating that the structural analysis based on IGA and the ECL method can be reliably used in the context of FSI.  In order to compare the time-averaged flow, the statistics in the midplane y/D = 0 are once more selected. Fig. 20 provides a comparison of the first- and second-order moments predicted by FSI-LES-IGA with the previous FSI-LES-FEM results and the experimental data. As aforementioned the ECL method has no significant effect on the deformation of the FSI interface, which is only slightly deformed in this case. Therefore, the results obtained by FSI-LES-FEM with ECL are very similar to those predicted by FSI-LES-FEM and are not shown here. Additionally, the time-averaged transition4 and separation5 locations are summarized in Table 2. In order to determine the position of transition, a simple method relying on the Reynolds shear stress u′w′/U 2 ∞ is applied, which can be considered as a quantity defining the exchange of momentum into the boundary layer. The threshold for u′w′/U 2 ∞ is set to −0.001 as used in Schmidt and Breuer (2014). The flow characteristics predicted by both simulations are globally similar. The approaching flow in front of the obstacle remains nearly identical, since the flexible structure has a minor impact on it. The flow accelerates over the front part of the hemisphere, becomes turbulent and detaches near the apex. The transition location of the present FSI-LES-IGA case moves slightly downstream in comparison to FSI-LES-FEM. This observation can be attributed to the better representation of the FSI interface on the fluid side due to IGA. A smoother surface leads to a later transition from the laminar to the turbulent flow regime. Similar to the transition, the separation location shifts downstream, but it also slightly moves in vertical direction. This change is rather small, implying no major difference in the size of the recirculation area. However, as depicted in Fig. 20(a) the global shape of the recirculation area predicted by FSI-LES-IGA fits better to the experimental data. The same is true for the reattachment point. The wake does not strongly differ, except concerning the quasi horizontal dividing streamline which is found at a higher position in case of FSI-LES-IGA tending towards the experiments. Moreover, the region of high Reynolds stresses of the shear layer (visible in Figs. 20(b)--20(d)) tends to decrease for the FSI-LES-IGA simulation in agreement with the experiments. It correlates with the lower standard deviations of the displacements observed with FSI-LES-IGA in Fig. 19. The comparison of both simulation results with the experimental data shows a global improvement of the flow field predicted by the FSI-LES-IGA setup.  4 The transition point is the location where the laminar flow becomes turbulent. 5 The separation point or line is defined where the flow velocity gradient in wall-normal direction is equal to zero.  \\x0c388  A.

The residual energy EΩFSI at the FSI interface defined in Eq. (35) against the time is shown in Fig. 21. Additionally, the time evolution of the work of the fluid forces at this interface WΩFSI is plotted. These results are gathered for a given dimensionless time interval of ∆T ∗ = 4, but not at the same simulation time spans. Moreover, the flow around the airinflated flexible hemisphere is turbulent, adding a chaotic contribution to the instantaneous results. Therefore, a direct quantitative comparison of the curves is not possible. For the setups FSI-LES-FEM without and with ECL the residual energy curves are almost identical, which is due to the small displacements observed in this case. The absolute value of EΩFSI stays around 10−6 N m, which is small compared to the work of the fluid forces. Concerning the FSI-LES-IGA setup the associated residual energy EΩFSI is three orders of magnitude lower (around 10−9 N m). Similar to the FSI cavity  \\x0cA. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

Summarizing, this FSI application shows the relevance of the applied numerical methodology for 3D flexible membrane structures. The smooth representation of the FSI interface provided by NURBS allows for an improvement of the static and dynamic behavior compared to the case where standard FEM discretizations are used.  5. Influence of the artificial roughness of the deformed interface  In an FSI simulation based on non-matching grids, a mapping procedure is required to ensure a correct exchange of the displacement and traction fields. The mapping between both meshes implies that the quality of the FSI interface is driven by the coarser grid. Contrary to the previous investigation on the flexible hemisphere using IGA, in the case where the discretization is based on FEM as in De Nayer et al. (2018a), the coarser grid is usually the structural one. In such a case, when the structure is discretized using a coarse finite element mesh but only subject to small displacements (as observed in the flexible hemisphere application), the interface quality is not overly degraded and has generally only a moderate influence on the results. However, if the structure undergoes large displacements, a low resolution of the FSI interface due to the FEM mesh is particularly critical on the fluid solution. Facets, corresponding to the structural elements, break through (see Fig. 22(c)). The surface is not smooth anymore and an artificial roughness appears on the fluid side, which is of particular importance for eddy-resolving simulation methodologies such as LES. In order to investigate the influence of this artificial roughness on the predicted flow field, a test case derived from the wall-mounted flexible hemisphere is studied.  5.1. Case setup  Initially, the geometry of the problem is exactly a rigid hemisphere (De Nayer et al., 2018b) (see Fig. 22(a)), while the flow field is initially predicted by a normal large-eddy simulation. Then, the prediction is continued by a one-way coupled simulation6 based on the partitioned approach described in Section 2. A significantly large displacement is progressively imposed to the hemispherical shape on the structural side within a time interval of 1000 time steps. The final form represents the 8th eigenmode (see Fig. 22(b)) of the linear modal analysis carried out in De Nayer et al. (2018a). After reaching its final shape, the large-eddy simulation continues as a pure CFD prediction. Prior to any analysis the CFD simulation is performed for a dimensionless time interval of ∆T ∗ = 20 in order to reach a new statistically steady state. Four different set-ups are taken into account: The first one relies on IGA for the structural discretization (see Section 4.1.1) and is considered as the reference. In the three other cases, standard finite element discretizations are used for the structure. Three of the unstructured meshes used in De Nayer et al. (2018a) are tested: A coarse one with 908 FE, an intermediate with 1926 FE and a fine one with 4080 FE.  The artificial roughness seen by the fluid solver can be evaluated using the FSI interface from the simulation with the isogeometric structural discretization as the reference. The arithmetic average roughness Ra and the root-mean-square roughness Rq are computed as defined in DIN EN ISO 4287:2010-07:  Ra =  1  n  n ∑  i=1  i − r IGA |r FEM  i  |  and  Rq =  \\ued6a \\ued6b \\ued6b √  1  n  n ∑  (r FEM i  i=1  − r IGA i  )2,  (38)  6 One-way coupled herein means that the displacement is prescribed on the hemisphere without interaction with the fluid flow.  \\x0c390  A.

Both formulas evaluate the roughness based on the grooves and the peaks of a rough surface (here FEM) in comparison with a smooth one (herein IGA). The definition of Rq is similar to Ra. However, Rq is more sensitive to the grooves and peaks than Ra. The grid applied in the fluid solver is the same for all cases considered. The medium grid (4.3 × 106 CVs) is used as in Section 4. The number of nodes on the interface n is equal to 35,280. Table 3 summarizes these artificial roughness values found on the surface of the deformed hemisphere for the three simulations utilizing different finite element meshes.  As expected, both roughnesses Ra and Rq decrease by increasing the grid resolution. Due to its definition, Rq generates  higher values emphasizing even more the deviations of the deformed FSI interface from the IGA reference shape.  In order to quantify the impact of this artificial roughness on the flow field, data are gathered and time-averaged during a dimensionless time interval of ∆T ∗ ≥ 500. Two planes are selected to compare the results: The x--z-plane, i.e., the symmetry plane at y/D = 0 and the x--y-plane at z/D = 0.35, where the deformation of the shape is the most prominent. In these planes some relevant quantities are compared and the results obtained by IGA are considered as the reference.  5.2. Results and discussion  Fig. 23 represents the first-order moments, i.e., the time-averaged streamwise u/U∞ and vertical w/U∞ velocities. Significant differences between the reference solution and the solution obtained using FEM 908 case are observed. The artificial roughness on the top strongly influences the location of the separation and thus the recirculation area and the wake. Table 4 provides a comparison of the location of the reattachment point7 for each case using the IGA case as reference. The FEM 908 case leads to an error of more than 20% on this flow characteristic. The first-order moments in the wake obtained for the FEM 1926 and 4080 cases nicely converge to the IGA reference data. These observations are supported by the second-order moments in the same plane in Fig. 24 and 25, particularly for the FEM 4080 case. As expected, the changes in the Reynolds stresses show that an increase of the artificial roughness on the interface leads to a stronger mixing and thus a strong overestimation of the Reynolds stresses in the separated shear layer.  The flow results in the horizontal plane at z/D = 0.35 visible in Fig. 27 show even more discrepancies between the low resolution case (FEM 908) and the high resolution ones (FEM 4080, IGA): For the former the flow detaches earlier and the  7 The reattachment point is located in the wake where the dividing streamline of the recirculation area attaches to the wall again (saddle point  visible in Fig. 26).  \\x0cA.

This asymmetry is also visible in the time-averaged streamlines on the wall and on the deformed structure depicted in Fig. 26. The initial hemispherical shape and the displacements applied are symmetric with respect to y = 0. However, the mapping combined with an unstructured and therefore not exactly symmetric finite element mesh results in a small asymmetry in the final deformed shape. This leads to slightly different local values of the artificial roughness, which generate a perceptible flow asymmetry in the wake. It has to be noted that this asymmetry is not due to a too short time-averaging process, since the results are time-averaged over a dimensionless time interval of ∆T ∗ ≥ 500.  To conclude, the mapping between non-matching grids forms an FSI interface, whose resolution corresponds to the coarser grid, which is typically used on the structure side. In case a FEM mesh is used for the discretization of the structure, the interface is represented by the structural elements as facets implying an artificial roughness. This roughness increases with the decrease of the grid resolution and with the increase of the structural displacement. In case of large displacements the effects of this artificial roughness on the flow field are not negligible: Separation and reattachment locations are significantly influenced and expected symmetries of the flow field are lost. Obviously, IGA is of invaluable benefit here since it automatically guarantees a smooth interface.  6. Computational costs related to the interface description  The FSI methodology in the present study (i.e., Sections 2--4) is based on a standard partitioned approach. Therefore, the total CPU consumption for an FSI simulation is the sum of the computational time of the CFD problem, the computational time of the CSD problem and the computational time of the mapping and transfer between the CFD and CSD solvers. For each case the CFD problem is solved using a parallelized and well-optimized solver. The CSD problem is solved serially. The mapping and data transfer are also done serially, since the sizes of the different problems under consideration are small enough. The computational costs related to the FSI cavity benchmark are not provided here because the size of the corresponding coupled problem is very small and the CPU-time needed for each problem and for one time-step is under 10 ms. Thus, the cavity FSI benchmark cannot be used for the evaluation of the proposed methodology in terms of CPU resources and computational time. Therefore, the computational cost of the presented methodology is evaluated based on the flexible hemisphere case. The related simulations are carried out on a cluster with Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge E5-2650 v2 processors operating at 2.60 GHz coupled with an Infiniband QDR network.  \\x0c392  A. Apostolatos, G.

Since the flexible hemisphere case is simulated with a loose FSI coupling algorithm, only one FSI-iteration is carried out at each time-step, leading to a quasi constant computational resources for the CFD problem.  As expected for an FSI case, the CPU-time consumed by the fluid problem is significantly larger than the CPU-time consumed by the structural problem for all simulations considered. However, the computational resources required by the IGA structural solver are not negligible compared to the FEM structural solver. This can be attributed to the use of high-order NURBS basis functions (see Section 2.1.2).  The initialization phase of the mapping comprises MPI data exchanges between the CFD and CSD solvers and the steps of the algorithmic procedure described in Section 2.3 except Eq. (28) or Eq. (31). The transfer step for the coupling part comprises the transformation of the field q (displacement or traction field) in both directions (see Eq. (28) in case of FSI simulations where the structural and the fluid problems interact directly or Eq. (31) in case of FSI simulations using the ECL). The given computational time of this transfer step includes also the MPI data exchange between the solvers.  The computational cost of the initial mapping phase is negligible compared to the total time of the full FSI simulation, which requires more than 106 time steps. The computational part related to the transfer of the fields (displacements and tractions) between the domains depends on the problem size and the chosen discretization. Within FSI-LES-IGA, the amount of data is typically larger leading to larger coupling matrices (Crn, Cnr and Crr) and therefore higher CPU time consumption. As it can be seen in Eq. (31), the application of the ECL adds supplementary costs at each transfer:  \\x0cA. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

Rigid deformed hemisphere: Time-averaged streamlines near the bottom wall and on the surface of the rigid deformed hemisphere.  Indeed, two successive transformations are required for one field leading to doubled computational costs compared to the standard FSI-LES-IGA.  Although the use of the ECL introduces additional computational costs at each transfer, the solution of the whole coupled problem with FEM using ECL is generally much faster than solving the same FSI problem with IGA. Therefore, combining an available FEM structural discretization with the ECL is an attractive concept for engineers in term of efficiency. It is worth noting that the FSI simulations using a structural solver based on IGA have the big advantage that no mesh generation is needed as the model can be directly imported from CAD (Teschemacher et al., 2018). On the contrary for the structural solvers based on FEM the costly mesh generation step is unavoidable.  The influence of the FSI interface description on the computational costs of the fluid solver is worth noting. The average CPU-time values for one time-step of the CFD problem presented in Section 5 are summarized in Table 6. It can be deduced  \\x0c394  A. Apostolatos, G. De Nayer, K.-U.

Conclusions and outlook  In the context of FSI simulations involving complex geometries an exact representation of the FSI interface is of great importance. Recently, with the introduction of the isogeometric analysis in computational structural mechanics, the exact description of the geometry from a CAD software can be directly used as basis for the structural solution. To allow the coupling between structures discretized using IGA and fluid flows discretized with the finite volume scheme, an isogeometric mortar-based mapping method is elaborated and evaluated in the present study. It enables FSI simulations with isogeometrically discretized structures and hence a smooth representation of the FSI interface.  At first the complete numerical methodology for solving fluid--structure interaction problems involving thin-walled membranous structures is shown based on a partitioned solution strategy relying on the ALE approach and the LES technique for turbulent flows. An introduction to membrane structural analysis is provided, while subsequently the application of IGA for the discretization of this kind of problems is shown. In order to accurately solve the FSI problem, the displacement and traction fields need to be properly exchanged at the interface between both domains, whereas the FSI interface has to be accurately represented. This is done by the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method, which is the core of the present study and enables a rigorous evaluation of the influence of the interface description. The variational form of the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method is described along with the corresponding discrete system of equations and implementation aspects. Firstly, its application to FSI simulations involving isogeometrically discretized structures, where the displacement and traction fields need to be transformed between a low-order discretized surface and a surface which is parametrized using high-order NURBS, is demonstrated. Subsequently, the Exact Coupling Layer concept is presented: The ECL method allows for a smooth transformation of the displacement and traction fields across the FSI interface between two low-order discretizations by taking advantage of the smoothing properties of the isogeometric mortar-based mapping technique. This is especially beneficial when the structure is discretized with significantly less elements than the fluid interface for, i.e., FSI simulations involving turbulent flows. The ECL concept prevents kinks resulting from the structural deformation, which is highly advantageous for the CFD solution.  The aforementioned applications are firstly shown for the simple cavity FSI benchmark, where the consistency of the method is validated. A single C 1-continuous membrane patch is employed. The results are compared against the standard mortar-based method, when a standard finite element discretization of the membrane is used demonstrating an excellent agreement. Subsequently, the effects of smoothing the transferred fields with the ECL concept is highlighted based on the same FSI benchmark. A very coarse finite element discretization for the membrane is used while keeping the fluid discretization unchanged. Although the discretization of the membrane is very coarse, the application of ECL guarantees a smooth representation of the FSI interface and the artificial kinks arising from the structural deformation on a coarse low-order mesh are not transferred into the fluid domain. Then, the FSI case of the turbulent flow around an air-inflated flexible hemisphere is carried out. A smooth C 1-continuous isogeometric discretization of the hemisphere is used for the structural boundary value problem, whereas the flow is described by a wall-resolved LES. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data and the numerical results obtained with the low-order FEM discretization of the membrane. The results suggest an improvement of the overall FSI behavior predicted by FSI-LES-IGA. This can be attributed to the smoothness and the better representation of the FSI interface by NURBS. Lastly, a significantly scaled deformation pattern of the hemisphere taken from one of the structural eigenmode shapes is imposed on the fluid FSI interface. Three gradually refined finite element meshes and the smooth isogeometric parametrization of the hemisphere used within the aforementioned FSI case are considered. A pure CFD analysis is performed for these four cases. The low-order FEM discretization combined with the large displacements imply a faceted representation of the surface, which is generating artificial surface roughness. The comparison of the time-averaged first- and second-order moments suggest a significant influence of this artificial interface roughness on the flow results. It highlights the necessity of interface smoothness for CFD and subsequently FSI simulations, showing the advantage of the presented isogeometric mortar-based mapping method as well as the isogeometric structural analysis in case of large deformation FSI simulations.  Although the proposed methodology does not ensure the conservation of the interface energy by construction, the results obtained for the FSI cases tested show that the corresponding error is negligible when the mortar-based mapping method is employed. Moreover, a significant improvement of the interface energy conservation is observed when using the isogeometric mortar-based mapping method in comparison to the standard mortar-based mapping method.  A smooth representation of the FSI interface obtained during simulations based on high-order discretizations globally leads to higher computational costs at each time step than low-order discretizations due to the higher computational  \\x0c396  A.

Nevertheless, they are advantageous due to the following reasons: Firstly, the NURBS-based high-order parametrized geometries can be directly imported from CAD avoiding the costly mesh generation step, which is necessary for low-order FEM discretizations. Secondly, a smooth FSI interface leads to a faster convergence of the fluid solver reducing the required CPU-time. The best compromise between low computational costs and a smooth representation of the FSI interface is found with the proposed Exact Coupling Layer (ECL) concept.  Future work can be focused on extending the herein proposed isogeometric mortar-based method to complex realworld CAD geometries involving trimmed multipatches, thus enabling FSI on geometric models stemming directly from industrial scale CAD. Additionally, FSI problems with very large deformations can be studied in order to further investigate the influence of the FSI interface description.  Acknowledgments  The authors thank F.

Evaluation of isogeometric model for the flexible hemisphere  A.1. Steady-state structural analysis  In order to evaluate the isogeometric model of the flexible hemisphere case, the steady calibration case described in Wood et al. (2018) is considered for the three isogeometric discretizations: One using 144 piecewise biquadratic C 1-continuous elements, one using 625 piecewise biquadratic (low-order) C 1-continuous elements and one using 625 piecewise bicubic (high-order) C 2-continuous elements. The corresponding geometries are obtained using the URS formfinding method as explained in Section 4.1.1. The steady calibration case works as follows: The pressure difference between the interior and the exterior of the membrane is steadily increased, while measuring the membrane displacement at the apex. The flexible structure is subjected to its self-weight. Its homogeneous and isotropic pre-stress is chosen equal to nmembrane = 7794.5 Pa as computed in De Nayer et al. (2018a).  The results of the three different isogeometric discretizations are shown in Fig. A.28 and compared with the experimental data of Wood et al. (2018) and the numerical FEM results of De Nayer et al. (2018a). It can be observed that all isogeometric discretizations deliver satisfactory results, whereas the apex displacement provided by the discretizations involving 625 biquadratic and bicubic elements are nearly identical. Therefore, it can be deduced that a sufficiently fine isogeometric discretization for obtaining a highly accurate discretization-independent solution is achieved for the steady validation case.  \\x0cA.

Dynamic structural analysis: Comparison of the simulation results with the experimental data.  A.2. Dynamic structural analysis  The three isogeometric discretizations used in A.1 are herein employed within the unsteady validation case introduced  in Wood et al. (2018). An impulse load F (t) of the form { 0.018 N , t < 0.001 s ,  F (t) =  0  else ,  (A.1)  is applied at an angle φ = π/4 in the meridian direction (see De Nayer et al. (2018a) for more details). The standard second-order Newmark scheme with a time step of magnitude ∆t = 10−3 s is chosen for the time discretization as explained in Section 2.1.3. The simple Rayleigh damping model is applied with the mass- and the stiffness-proportional parameters set to αr = 17.47 and βr = 1.89 × 10−4, respectively.  For the three isogeometric parametrizations the vertical displacements dz depicted in Fig. A.29(a) are compared with the results obtained by the finite element mesh with 1926 elements (De Nayer et al., 2018a) and the experimental data (Wood et al., 2018). In addition, the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. A.29(b). It can be observed that a very good agreement of both isogeometric discretizations using 625 elements with the finite element solution and the experimental data is achieved, whereas the isogeometric discretization using 144 elements deviates significantly. Thus, the latter is not considered for the FSI simulation. Since both isogeometric discretizations with 625 elements deliver almost the same solution, the one with biquadratic elements is chosen for the FSI setup for efficiency reasons.

Similar to the in-/exclusion criteria, this classification functions as a soft criteria, specifying the conditions to evaluate a given document. By using certain **thresholds** over the document relevancy, the document set is divided into subsets that *must (M)*, *should (S)*, *could (C)* and *won't (W)* be considered. Unlike hard criteria, these are guidelines and aim as a decision support to which works to prioritise.\n",

    "* Documents *must* be evaluated if their relevancy score is above 75 % (M=.75), they have been published within the last year or in a Q1/A venue.\n",
    "* Documents *should* be evaluated if their relevancy score is above 50 % (S=.50) or they have been published within the last 3 years.\n",
