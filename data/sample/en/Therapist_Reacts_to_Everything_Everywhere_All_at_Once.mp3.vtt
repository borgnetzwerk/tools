00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
This movie is an exploration of nihilism, right?

00:03.040 --> 00:06.320
The concept of meaninglessness, of there is no objective truth,

00:06.320 --> 00:11.040
there is no objective morality, that we're all just specks floating out in space.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.200
If nothing we do matters, then the only thing that matters is what we do.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.520
I think we're more alike than we're different, and there's more that unites us and separates us,

00:21.520 --> 00:28.960
but we forget that because, honestly, we may know some of what's going on, but none of us know.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.000
None of us have any idea what the heck is going on.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.480
And how crucial it is to be kind.

00:34.480 --> 00:39.520
Kindness and optimism, they're not the tools of the ignorant or the naive or the stupid

00:39.520 --> 00:41.280
who don't know what's going on in the world.

00:42.320 --> 00:46.800
This is drinking from the fire hose for two hours.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.760
And 15 minutes.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.880
And 15 minutes, and it is sublime.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.840
There's a very beautiful side to nihilism as well,

00:53.840 --> 00:59.760
which is that we are the masters of our own fates, and we decide what's right and wrong,

00:59.760 --> 01:03.760
and we decide, you know, what our actions are going to mean.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.320
Welcome to Cinema Therapy.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.600
I'm Alan Seawright, professional filmmaker who needs therapy, and that is...

01:17.600 --> 01:20.080
Jonathan Decker, licensed therapist who loves movies.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.360
What are we doing? What's going on?

01:21.360 --> 01:24.400
Alan Seawright I would like you to react to all the things.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.440
Jonathan Decker Everything?

01:25.440 --> 01:27.760
Alan Seawright Uh-huh. In all of the places.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.600
Jonathan Decker At one single-lingual time.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.080
Single.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.800
Alan Seawright One single-lingual time.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.240
Jonathan Decker Everything everywhere all at once.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.560
I take it because we have bagels as guests.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.880
Alan Seawright Our guests are the everything bagel.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.800
I put everything on a bagel and I gave it to you.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.480
Jonathan Decker I love it.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.520
This is my new favorite movie, and I'm not saying that just...

01:45.520 --> 01:47.200
Alan Seawright This is not recency bias.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.840
Jonathan Decker No, this is... I have a very thorough vetting process and my last favorite,

01:51.840 --> 01:53.680
310 to Yuma, was there for like 12 years.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.720
Alan Seawright Oh, a long, long time.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.280
Jonathan Decker Yeah. So that's not faint praise.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.280
This has everything I could ever want in a movie.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.640
Alan Seawright And it has it everywhere.
